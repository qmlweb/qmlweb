/*

QmlWeb.qrc is analogous to the Qt Resource System. It is expected to map a path
within the resource system to the following pieces of data:

1) For a QML Component, it is the return value of QmlWeb.parse
2) For a JavaScript file, it is the return value of QmlWeb.jsparse
2) For an image, it is any URL that an <img> tag can accept (e.g. a standard
   URL to an image resource, or a "data:" URI). If there is no entry for a
   given qrc image path, it will fall back to passing the path right through to
   the DOM. This is mainly a convenience until support for images is added to
   gulp-qmlweb.

The "data-qml" tag on <body> can be set to a "qrc://" URL like
"qrc:///root.qml" to use a pre-parsed "/root.qml" from QmlWeb.qrc.

Since relative URLs are resolved relative to the URL of the containing
component, any relative URL set within a file in the resource system will also
resolve within the resource system. To access a Component, JavaScript or image
file that is stored outside of the resources system from within the resource
system, a full URL must be used (e.g. "http://www.example.com/images/foo.png").

Vice-versa, in order to access a Component, JavaScript or image file that is
stored within the resource system from outside of the resource system, a full
"qrc://" URL must be used (e.g. "qrc:///images/foo.png").
